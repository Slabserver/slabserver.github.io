Bans can become a controversial topic, and information spread through word of mouth can be twisted into a completely different meaning.

If you believe staff made a mistake, explain so respectfully and truthfully. </li> <li>Having a positive history in the community  Staff will be more inclined to trust a member with a good history in the community (following the rules, being polite to others, etc.) and to offer them more leniency under the presumption of good faith.     <ul> <li>If a member has a history of causing problems, breaking the rules, or repeatedly skirting along the edge of what the rules allow, staff will be less inclined to show leniency toward them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In general, ban appeals are brought up to staff to be discussed as a whole.
