Bans can become a controversial topic, and information spread through word of mouth can be twisted into a completely different meaning.

If you believe staff made a mistake, explain so respectfully and truthfully. </li> <li>Having a positive history in the community  Staff will be more inclined to trust a member with a good history in the community (following the rules, being polite to others, etc.) and to offer them more leniency under the presumption of good faith.     <ul> <li>If a member has a history of causing problems, breaking the rules, or repeatedly skirting along the edge of what the rules allow, staff will be less inclined to show leniency toward them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In general, ban appeals are brought up to staff to be discussed as a whole.

Ionos UK let us select a server in the US, but didn\u2019t have our required server specifications and also charged significantly more for no apparent reason.

Every single game server and Discord bot has now been migrated, and we are no longer paying for our SoYouStart server. Our documentation has also been updated accordingly.</p> <ul> <li>This move has been months in the works, and not only has this come with a performance bump and increased storage space, it finally unblocked a couple other items on our ZenHub boards, most notably:<ul> <li>We\u2019ve fixed the dreaded \u2018join survival but end up on creative\u2019 bug!</li> <li>We\u2019ve moved hosting of stats, dynmap, and bluemap back onto our server, rather than have them hosted externally by Frogperson.</li> <li>As part of this migration, our server IP and several ports have changed, so if you weren\u2019t already, please use our slabserver.org links, particularly with the survival/creative join bug now addressed.</li> <li>We\u2019re finally able to continue our CoreProtect database migration to MySQL, started way back in February and paused for nearly 6 months due to lack of storage space!</li> </ul> </li> <li>As part of this move, we\u2019ve deleted our Gmod, Terraria, and Building Game servers that had been powered off for several months, and have no plans to rehost in the foreseeable future.</li> <li>I\u2019ll take this moment to speak more personally about the server move. We internally committed to moving to a better host on 27th July, so it\u2019s been a long long journey to get us to this point. Everything from scouring options, discussing cost and locations in staff channels and #suggestions, getting our server order past Ionos\u2019s fraud detection, breaking down the monolithic task of our data migration into more manageable chunks and then the painstaking task of ensuring no regressions along the way. A huge amount of thanks to Chris for all of his sysadmin help in rebuilding the dedi server from scratch. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have a clean slate for our server infrastructure, and I look forward to the months and years ahead being made easier by Ionos!</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We have a new application bot! Applications are now handled entirely through Discord DMs with Sethwing, taking full advantage of the new Discord button, selection menus and making for a much more snazzy experience overall. This also means we\u2019ve been able to remove our dependency on Google Drive entirely, which has been reflected in privacy.slabserver.org.</p> </li> <li> <p>We\u2019ve fixed several bugs with MinecraftStats, the tool that powers stats.slabserver.org, specifically cases where the statistics could end up in negative values.</p> </li> <li> <p>We now have a Golang bot that automatically polls the Mojang API for new snapshots or releases, and upon detecting a new release, will restart our Snapshot and Spawn servers automagically. The Snapshot server world even gets deleted and recreated each time! This bot currently runs as part of some Go HTTP experiments (and is affectionately named ErGobot), and while not likely to have a presence in Discord for the foreseeable future, will hopefully automate even more behaviour for our dedicated server in the months ahead.</p> </li> <li> <p>We\u2019ve begun preparing for our servers to upgrade to 1.18! Our Gamenight Server Installer already supports 1.18 (save for the UHC option), and we\u2019re doing what we can to prepare for the other major servers to update, ahead of Paper having stable support for Minecraft 1.18.

No. Was this fun? \u2026No, not really, GitHub\u2019s API is a bit crap.</p> </li> <li> <p>We\u2019ve made some network changes to our servers to cancel all attempts to connect to our SMP servers except through our proxy. This has no bearing on normal players, but was done to prevent offline UUIDs attempting to connect to our servers and spoof messages in-game.</p> </li> <li> <p>We updated our Snacker/Inactivity bot to the latest JDA, and now have support for tracking messages in threads! No more avoiding the Robot Overlords, the Robot Overlords see all.</p> </li> <li> <p>We've... taken breaks. Several of the staff team have reduced their presence the past couple months, in order to better focus on their energy, and mental health. Running this community day in day out can be a lot of work, with so much still that doesn't get covered in these transparency reports - rule infringements, bans, appeals, infrastructure issues, debugging, proof of concept ideas, seecret projects - the list goes on. While our team actions may be a little fewer and farther between, we really appreciate people being patient with us as we try to take care of the community as well as ourselves.</p> </li> </ul>","boost":0.5},{"location":"transparency/may-2022/#server-donation-links","title":"Server Donation Links","text":"<p>Paypal: https://slabserver.org/paypal</p> <p>Patreon: https://slabserver.org/patreon</p> <p><sup>\u00b9 Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup></p> <p><sup>\u00b2 The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots.

In-game messages cannot be reported, and of course neither can any ingamechat messages. We've also made sure Mojang-signed public keys are not enforced on our server, so that players can connect with client mods like 'No Chat Reports'.</p> <ul> <li>This was announced quite publicly in the Discord but I wanted to call it out explicitly here again as it's quite a significant stance to take against it, and people have expressed that acknowledging technical behind-the-scenes changes is a key thing they want from these transparency reports.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We've taken a big decision to disable enderman griefing in most circumstances, after significant player feedback and discussion. Endermen can still pick up grass, mycelium, podzol, and melons in the End dimension, to preserve support for griefing based farms for those blocks. Thanks to all those that gave their input on this discussion.</p> </li> <li> <p>We made several changes for the Resource World. Most notably, players can now set a spawn point in the Resource World when they die, a gameplay change that had the added benefit of resolving other respawn bugs. We now also support Discord integration when the Main World is empty, so that players out on grand adventures when the server is otherwise empty can be a little less lonely.</p> </li> <li> <p>We increased our miscellaneous <code>entity-activation-range</code> on Slabserver to align with server render distance, to solve some issues with  Evokers in Minecarts not moving correctly, as seen in Decked Out gameplay.</p> </li> <li> <p>We've done some reviews and tightening of security measures on our dedicated server, following some best practices raised by community members.</p> </li> <li> <p>We gave The Tunnel a few minor QoL tweaks that had been on the backlog for a while. The 'infinite loop stage' now plays a dragon roar and an echoing page turning sound effect, to help those who are soloing this and could easily miss the dragon loot table behaviour. We also tweaked the smoke and lava particle effects around the doors in Stage 3, to help those using minimal particle settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>We attempted, and completely failed, to investigate an issue where a player managed to somehow respawn in The Tunnel after dying in Decked Out. I don't really have much to say other than this is one of the most bizarre things we've seen and can't even begin to understand why or how this happened, but thought I'd share because shit like this is just a day in the life for us and life is pain.</p> </li> <li> <p>We've done a lot of work with our old Coreprotect data, and still have a fair bit to do. I'll cover this fully in Nov's transparency report as I'm hoping to have completed this saga within the next week or so.</p> </li> <li> <p>We've...got some redacted stuff on the board. I appreciate this isn't so helpful for you guys, but they're a couple of things we're just not ready to commit to publicly, and you should hear about both this year.</p> </li> </ul>","boost":0.5},{"location":"transparency/october-2022/#server-donation-links","title":"Server Donation Links","text":"<p>Paypal: https://slabserver.org/paypal</p> <p>Patreon: https://slabserver.org/patreon</p> <p><sup>\u00b9 Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup></p> <p><sup>\u00b2 The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots.

We had a long term goal to move our Coreprotect data from Sqlite to MySQL/MariaDB, as a proper SQL solution that best fits our use case. This was largely successful, but in the move had some mapping issues with some of the block IDs used internally by Coreprotect. Our cleanest solution to fix this was start a fresh database for Coreprotect, and keep the old data purely for reference purposes.</li> <li>We introduced a new plugin, Mineprotect, to access this old Coreprotect data ingame alongside our new data. This was an amazing QOL plugin by MC that helps to differentiate the data from the two plugins, and in cases of the aforementioned mapping issues where block IDs aren't tracked properly, shows the possible block/item IDs that Coreprotect could be referring to.</li> <li>We will, eventually, move this old data to a form of external 'glacier' cloud storage to free up some well needed space while still allowing us to access it, but the estimated costs for this were higher than anticipated and as of right now, we are no further on moving this.</li> <li> <p>While very little of this work was done in November, I promised in Octobers Transparency Report this'd be covered in November's, so here you are!</p> </li> <li> <p>We announced the Hermitfan UHC, taking place on January 22nd!

As always, abuse of this power will result in its removal.</li> <li>We created a new #gaming channel, which is being trialled in the Community Games category.</li> <li>We added @WatchParty and @Civilization roles for #gamenight, by popular request.</li> <li>We created a wiki page with a list of allowed and disallowed mods for clarity and more centralised documentation here.</li> <li>We discussed future use of Forum Channels in our Discord, and hope to trial them for the next <code>#modded-bulletin</code> channel.</li> <li>We\u2019ll be reviewing our rule regarding low effort/quality content for more consistent application. We\u2019ve received conflicting feedback on this over the past few years, so we will be taking some time with this trying to define what low quality content is and examples of conditions in which such content may be removed.</li> <li>For the first time since Season 3 began, we\u2019ve recorded a small majority of members being in favour of a survival server reset. As indicated on the question, we have no plans to reset at this time, but we will continue to monitor community feedback on this issue.</li> <li>We\u2019re trialling some changes to #food and #pictures regarding the Picture of the Month feature to try to make the user experience more natural. We\u2019ve changed the emote from the trophy to the yum emote in #food, and SethWing will automatically add the trophy emote to images in #pictures. SethWing will not count its own vote when tallying results for Picture of the Month.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We've created a downloads page with links to world downloads and resource packs we\u2019ve released over the years. This is part of wider ongoing efforts to archive more of our communities media over the years, and will be updated in the future as more important downloads and torrents become available.</p> </li> <li> <p>We removed the Resource World message that warned players the Discord integration will not work while the main world is empty. This issue was fixed several months ago, but is being documented now!</p> </li> <li> <p>We hosted the Hermitfan UHC after many months of planning, to great success - not only did our organisation and infrastructure help the event run smoothly and with barely a hitch, our team won too! You can find Duo's wonderful video of the event here, and after the overwhelmingly positive feedback about the event, we hope to host more cross-community events later this year.</p> </li> <li> <p>We've made changes to how these Transparency Reports are compiled - MC has very kindly offered to help me collate these as we go throughout the month, to try and make sure the reports are more punctual!

The details of this are not yet finalized, so stay tuned. - We've launched the Season 4 Community Project Signups, looking for people to help with various parts of designing our Spawn and Nether Hub.

We've searched countless seeds using the amazing Cubiomes tool, slowly whittling down our selection from discussions back and forth within the team. The seed was first found by JadeLake, and slowly but surely became our top choice through a very lengthy process of elimination. We're really pleased with the final pick, and we can't wait for you to see it live on the server. - We've assembled Spawn and Nether Hub design teams, that are hard at work to help design the form and functionality of these areas ahead of launch. There's some truly amazing plans going on within these groups, and if you keep your eye on the voice channels you might even catch them doing some of the designing live!    - Please note that anyone can help to build these designs once Season 4 goes live, or contribute further to the projects. This is just to get our initial approach and functionality in place for these areas. - We've welcomed GamingTwist as a Technical Assistant to the team, where he will be helping out on the techy side of our community work a little more officially. - We added 1.20.6+ support for Gamenight Servers, and added Java 21 support to any Gamenight servers created for Minecraft 1.19 and above.   - As part of this, we also fixed an issue where Gamenight servers created for Minecraft 1.17.x would use an incompatible version of Java. - We've conducted some Season 4 stress testing, to better understand what optimisation steps we are able to take on the server, both prior to and during the launch. We're fairly confident that the server will perform much better than any Survival launch so far! - We've updated all of our datapacks for Season 4, refactoring our files around the significant and sweeping (and often stupid) changes that Mojang has made in 1.20.6 and 1.21.   - Of particular note, we've removed The Tunnel and Etho's Wrench files, as well as the custom coral crafting recipes. We've now added a shapeless undyed shulker box crafting recipe for consistency with the other custom shulker recipes.     - Please pray for no more breaking changes before 1.21 releases, this has all been a massive pain to update.   - Please also note that Slabserver advancements will not be added for launch, as most of the Season 3 ones will eventually carry over once we have new coordinates for the location-based triggers. - We began the long-awaited Decked Out community crossover event, welcoming the Iskall, Rendog, and Xisuma communities onto custom server instances of the Decked Out map. The events have been received incredibly well by all the communities, and this event wouldn't have been possible without Twist's invaluable work. While Tango and his staff team have now declined to join in, we hope to welcome the GoodTimesWithScar and VintageBeef communities within this month as well, who have been far more enthusiastic about exploring our DO dungeon. - We rewrote Etho's Wrench as a plugin, to move the more complex logic away from datapack jank and to make it more maintainable in the future.   - This task has existed in some form or other on the staff board for 3.5 years, and we finally got there in the end! -  We've significantly refined our internal Kanban board as you likely saw in the screenshot above, moving most of our 'In Draft' issues that weren't previously visible within State of the Slab into fully refined issues.  As part of this, the label system has been overhauled too, now showing a Priority and Size estimate for each issue, and a Milestone label to categorise related issues.   - These Priority and Size labels are purely informational, intended to provide the community with more context about the issue. They will always be a rough estimate for the amount of work involved... though quite honestly are just based on vibes.     - A neat thing to note is the date that the issue on the sidebar was created, just to highlight the timeframes for some of our work! The 'Begin Season 4 of Slabserver' was initially drafted after the 2023 Great Slabserver Poll, as we started to refine the technical and infrastructure improvements we'd need for a new Season. It's rare that we can share the more detailed view of these issues, but hopefully this is a fun little bit of proof for just how far in advance some things start to be worked on.</p>","boost":0.5},{"location":"transparency/june-2024/#server-donation-links","title":"Server Donation Links","text":"<p>Paypal: https://slabserver.org/paypal</p> <p>Patreon: https://slabserver.org/patreon</p> <p><sup>\u00b9 Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup></p> <p><sup>\u00b2 The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots.

Our farewell events included our prestigious awards show The Slabbys, and a finale tour of the server, both of which aimed to recognise the huge amount of creativity and time that people have put into this server during those five years. To end the season, a heartfelt speech was prepared for you all, which can be read here, and the Season 3 world download can be found here</p> </li> <li> <p>We setup and ran an extensive community-wide speedtest to our current datacentre, and a potential new server host, in order to further investigate and understand the widespread connection issues that members have experienced in terms of speed and stability. This speedtest was completed in two stages, and provided us with a huge amount of quantitive data to understand what benefits a potential server move for Season 4 would have. And so...</p> </li> <li> <p>We provided notice to cancel our server with the current host Ionos, and ordered a new dedicated server from Hetzner! We ordered the AX42 config, with an additional 1TB SSD and a 22TB HDD, which should also help to mitigate any of the storage issues we've experienced in the past couple years. This server move also brings a neat bump in server hardware for us once again, and with the results of the speedtest we're confident that this move should prove to be a much more stable connection for the majority of members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moving server hosts is no small feat for us to pull off, and certainly not an easy one, but we'll get no better opportunity to pull this off than during our S3-&gt;S4 downtime. Keep your fingers crossed for us having a smooth transfer over to the new server, and we'll share in #announcements when the server move is scheduled/completed!</p> </li> <li> <p>We... had an absolute nightmare of an experience trying to get hold of our server from Hetzner. Due to the custom server configuration we ordered by including the additional hard drives, our order took far longer than we anticipated to be physically provisioned in their datacentre, and ended up exceeding Hetzner's own estimates listed on their site, or provided by their support team on multiple occasions.</p> </li> <li>Over the course of the two weeks between Season 3 and Season 4, we contacted Hetzner's support and datacentre teams almost every single day, attempting to get any further information, accurate estimates for the server, or have it be expedited, given the rapidly approaching launch date of Season 4.</li> <li>This dragged on for long enough that we had to revert our cancellation of our old Ionos server, just to ensure that we had our old server to launch on for Season 4, should Hetzner not arrive in time. This ended up being a very wise move, given that our breakthrough with Hetzner came barely two days before Season 4 began.</li> <li> <p>Through our persistence and rapport with Hetzner's support team, or from them simply hoping to never hear from me ever again, they were able to help approve us a new AX42 server with no custom configuration that had just become available, and then lodge a support ticket with the datacentre to add the new drives. This proved to be significantly quicker, presumably due to the fact that this didn't require anything new to be physically built in the Hetzner datacentre, and not even two hours later, our Hetzner server was finally online.</p> <ul> <li>A huge thanks to their sales and support teams pulling through for us on this one!</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We've done far more technical setup behind-the-scenes for Season 4 than I can ever reasonably do justice in these Transparency Reports. Deprecating old plugins, configuring new plugins, reconfiguring our various Proxy plugins around the new Velocity setup. Transferring every gameserver and community bot over from Ionos to Hetzner, reconfiguring settings and databases in each server as a result, all while trying to minimise downtime for each. I cannot state enough just how much work has gone into the double-whammy of Season 4 and our server migration.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is a huge testament to my peers in the staff team, particularly Chris, that this was pulled off anywhere near as successfully as it has been - and for the most part been barely visible to the community. During the S4 launch, many of our databases were still running on the Ionos server while the Survival world ran on Hetzner, resulting in a crazy \"silly string and superglue\" style setup to get the launch working in time. But it all came together in the end, by the skin of our teeth, and so...</p> </li> <li> <p>We launched Season 4, finally, after six months of it being announced, and well over a year of internal planning and preparation for an eventual reset. As mentioned above, due to all the delays and hurdles we had getting hold of the new Hetzner server, getting the new Survival network online really came down to the wire, and I am incredibly proud of how well the launch went with all that considered.</p> </li> <li>We also developed a plugin for launch, simply named \"Buster\", that let us dynamically adjust settings such as render distance, simulation distance, and mobcap limits. This was the result of the internal stress testing we mentioned in our June 2024 Transparency Report, and made a huge difference to our server stability and performance on launch. To those who bet against Finey's promises of 20tps at launch, never bet against a bald man.</li> </ul>","boost":0.5},{"location":"transparency/august-2024/#the-other-stuff","title":"The other stuff","text":"<ul> <li> <p>We received a significant number of Paypal donations this month, in response to the Survival reset and dedicated server move.
