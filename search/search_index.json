Bans can become a controversial topic, and information spread through word of mouth can be twisted into a completely different meaning.       This can still happen if the member chooses to discuss it openly or to their friends, particularly if they are being dishonest or scapegoating the staff team, but this policy helps keep these incidents to a minimum.</p> </li> <li> <p>To protect our sources    Sometimes we receive anonymous reports from members in the community, and divulging information provided by them can lead to them being discovered by others and retaliated against. To protect their anonymity, we are sometimes unable to divulge information crucial to our decision.</p> </li> </ol> <p>We recognize this also has several downsides, and we may divulge limited information on a case-by-case basis.

If you believe staff made a mistake, explain so respectfully and truthfully. </li> <li>Having a positive history in the community  Staff will be more inclined to trust a member with a good history in the community (following the rules, being polite to others, etc.) and to offer them more leniency under the presumption of good faith.     <ul> <li>If a member has a history of causing problems, breaking the rules, or repeatedly skirting along the edge of what the rules allow, staff will be less inclined to show leniency toward them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In general, ban appeals are brought up to staff to be discussed as a whole.

Keep your fingers crossed for us having a smooth transfer over to the new server, and we'll share in #announcements when the server move is scheduled/completed!</p> </li> <li> <p>We... had an absolute nightmare of an experience trying to get hold of our server from Hetzner. Due to the custom server configuration we ordered by including the additional hard drives, our order took far longer than we anticipated to be physically provisioned in their datacentre, and ended up exceeding Hetzner's own estimates listed on their site, or provided by their support team on multiple occasions.</p> </li> <li>Over the course of the two weeks between Season 3 and Season 4, we contacted Hetzner's support and datacentre teams almost every single day, attempting to get any further information, accurate estimates for the server, or have it be expedited, given the rapidly approaching launch date of Season 4.</li> <li>This dragged on for long enough that we had to revert our cancellation of our old Ionos server, just to ensure that we had our old server to launch on for Season 4, should Hetzner not arrive in time. This ended up being a very wise move, given that our breakthrough with Hetzner came barely two days before Season 4 began.</li> <li> <p>Through our persistence and rapport with Hetzner's support team, or from them simply hoping to never hear from me ever again, they were able to help approve us a new AX42 server with no custom configuration that had just become available, and then lodge a support ticket with the datacentre to add the new drives. This proved to be significantly quicker, presumably due to the fact that this didn't require anything new to be physically built in the Hetzner datacentre, and not even two hours later, our Hetzner server was finally online.</p> <ul> <li>A huge thanks to their sales and support teams pulling through for us on this one!</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We've done far more technical setup behind-the-scenes for Season 4 than I can ever reasonably do justice in these Transparency Reports. Deprecating old plugins, configuring new plugins, reconfiguring our various Proxy plugins around the new Velocity setup. Transferring every gameserver and community bot over from Ionos to Hetzner, reconfiguring settings and databases in each server as a result, all while trying to minimise downtime for each. I cannot state enough just how much work has gone into the double-whammy of Season 4 and our server migration.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is a huge testament to my peers in the staff team, particularly Chris, that this was pulled off anywhere near as successfully as it has been - and for the most part been barely visible to the community. During the S4 launch, many of our databases were still running on the Ionos server while the Survival world ran on Hetzner, resulting in a crazy \"silly string and superglue\" style setup to get the launch working in time. But it all came together in the end, by the skin of our teeth, and so...</p> </li> <li> <p>We launched Season 4, finally, after six months of it being announced, and well over a year of internal planning and preparation for an eventual reset. As mentioned above, due to all the delays and hurdles we had getting hold of the new Hetzner server, getting the new Survival network online really came down to the wire, and I am incredibly proud of how well the launch went with all that considered.</p> </li> <li>We also developed a plugin for launch, simply named \"Buster\", that let us dynamically adjust settings such as render distance, simulation distance, and mobcap limits. This was the result of the internal stress testing we mentioned in our June 2024 Transparency Report, and made a huge difference to our server stability and performance on launch. To those who bet against Finey's promises of 20tps at launch, never bet against a bald man.</li> </ul>","boost":0.5},{"location":"transparency/august-2024/#the-other-stuff","title":"The other stuff","text":"<ul> <li> <p>We received a significant number of Paypal donations this month, in response to the Survival reset and dedicated server move.
