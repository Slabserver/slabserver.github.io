### Improved Transparency Reports

You will notice that this transparency report now runs until the 5th of each month. Starting in May, these will no longer be Donation Transparency Reports, and instead evolve into larger Transparency Reports.

Alongside the breakdowns of donations, we will have a 'State of the Slab' section. This will have a monthly snapshot of the staff team ZenHub kanban board⁴ that we use to track our various projects and tasks, along with a summary of the progress that the staff team has made that month.

The shift in date of our Transparency Reports is for two reasons:

- To better reflect the day of billing for the server (billed on the 5th each month)

- To be posted just after our monthly staff team meetings, a time that we naturally recap the ZenHub board, making summarising the progress much easier.

We hope this will be of interest to a decent portion of the active community, and help draw more attention to our transparency reports overall.

<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots. You can find more detail on this [in our documentation](../../../documentation/minecraft/server-architecture.md).</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>

<sup>⁴ There will be occasions that certain items on the board are redacted, should they still be in [draft](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#creating-draft-issues), or contain sensitive tasks or information.</sup>
