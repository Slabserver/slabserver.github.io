### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 20th of November 2021⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We finally got our server order through after weeks of back and forth with Ionos, and migrating to our new host is in progress. 
    - What was meant to be a very simple process turned out to be greatly complicated by Ionos needing to verify customer details for account creation. Ionos UK let us select a server in the US, but didn’t have our required server specifications and also charged significantly more for no apparent reason. Ionos US wouldn’t let me use Paypal, because it detected that my fallback payment method is a UK bank. Ionos CA let me use Paypal as the fallback UK bank, but then required a Canadan residency for account creation.
        - Rather than communicating these issues or requirements for proving Canadian residency, they instead froze the account we’d opened, and we later found this information out from their fraud team after reaching support through Twitter. Several more hours later and using Gellis’s Canadian residency to verify with Ionos CA, we finally got access to the server and Chris has been doing much of the sysadmin work to prepare us for the move.
-	We announced in the Discord that our Survival and Resource server will be down on 24 November for up to 48 hours while we move them over to Ionos. This is the main aspect of our move, and we’re hoping to have the rest moved over by the start of December. You can expect short periods of downtime for our other servers and bots, though nothing as long of a period as the main server.
-	We now uh, accidentally have an extra year of our slabserver.org domain, renewed until February 2023. In reviewing our domain settings, I noted to the staff team that Google Domains [required someone within the USA to complete the payment](https://i.imgur.com/e8rEkVa.png), and thought it’d be amusing to try just entering any random US postcode to see if there was any verification behind it. Well, there wasn’t, I now live in Beverly Hills, and slabserver.org is safe for another year. As for payment, this one’s on me <3
