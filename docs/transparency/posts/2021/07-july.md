### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 9th of July 2021⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the past month:**


- We updated Slabserver to 1.17! This update turned out to be one of our smoothest in recent years, though still required many hours of work from our team to update our plugins and data packs, as well as the hours spent updating the servers across the weekend. Huge thanks to the staff team for all the work here!
  - Despite the overall smooth upgrade, it wouldn’t be Slabserver without minor mishaps that I figured we’d share with you all. Upgrading our RW to 1.17 separately to the Main World led to an interesting problem where couldn’t connect to it, due to Main and Resource being on mismatched versions. We nearly had to upgrade the Main world a day early, but thanks to the magic of ViaVersion, we could trick the server to allow connections to the 1.17 RW with 1.16.5 clients! [Here’s some amusing screenshots of our panicked use of ViaVersion and the resulting wonky workarounds!](https://imgur.com/a/DygTmmu)

-	 We’ve now introduced a new process for naming our Resource Worlds, thanks to the voting booth idea introduced for the G cycle. Thanks to those who voted Galapagos!

-	We’re pleased to finally be providing transparency around several of our significant community bans. We've released documents detailing the events surrounding two previously prominent community members, and have opened a #staff-transparency channel for those that wish to discuss the documents, decision, or evidence with us.

-	We've given the Creative server has seen some Quality of Life upgrades! We now have `/r` functionality, colour names in chat, and an improved permissions system that’s consistent with our other servers.

-	We've made some small improvements to the subreddit too, with an updated sidebar and banner image. We are keen to give the subreddit a complete redesign, so if anyone has decent experience with CSS and give our transparency report hun a new kick of paint, please let us know!

¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.

²  The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots. You can find more detail on this [in our wiki](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Documentation/wiki/Architecture)

³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in 'rollover donations' within the transparency report.

⁴ There will be occasions that certain items on the board are redacted, should they contain sensitive tasks or information.

⁵ This address will only ever be used for community purposes. Any transactions you see on a blockchain explorer reflect community donations moving to the address, or being sent to an exchange to be converted into fiat money to make donations with. Any conversion from crypto into fiat will be noted in the donation breakdown. The cryptocurrencies accepted by Slabserver are not to be considered financial or investment advice.

⁶ [Nano](https://nano.org/) is an interesting cryptocurrency I stumbled upon with some really promising green tech. While I don't expect this address to be used, I believe that Nano allows us to receive the maximum % of your donation out of all available options, given that Paypal and Patreon seem to take an ever increasing cut.
