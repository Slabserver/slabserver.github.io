### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 14th of September 2021⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

-	We’re moving ahead with Ionos as our new server host, after several weeks of assessment and decision-making. While Hetzner is the more cost-effective choice for us, we’ve had a meaningful increase in donations and stakeholder funds. With the expectations that donations can sustain the new server price once we confirm our move, we feel this is the right choice to make for all our players across the globe.
	-	We’re looking to start this migration in October, as the technical staff members are all using September as an opportunity for rest and for vacations! We won’t have as much to update you on next month, but there’ll be lots to share once our migration is in progress. 
-	We’ve updated our Privacy Policy once again, with some important clarification around our transparency on bans, and what information we’re storing. You can find the latest privacy policy [here](https://privacy.slabserver.org).
-	We’ve written documentation for our `/gamenight` server command, to act as a getting started guide or help people with server management. You can find this documentation [here](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Documentation/wiki/Gamenight-Servers).
-	We've fixed issues with the `/me` and `/shrug` commands. The fix for `/me` is now live, and `/shruggie`'s fix [should be live soon](https://github.com/DaMarine/Slabserver-Bugs/issues/8#issuecomment-918059702) - Didy had [great fun](https://discord.com/channels/146701388234227712/151482247424376832/885870131211812865) hunting this down with the DiscordSRV team!
-	We've reviewed the current state of [Discord Threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ), and concluded that we're still not ready to open these up generally to everyone yet. At minimum, we will require [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) to add support so that our bot functionality can be used in them (particularly our moderation features).
  - Note that all staff members have permissions to create threads, so members may still request that we start threads in channels where appropriate, either via Chester or by DMing us.
