**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- As mentioned in our previous transparency report, several of our staff team used September as a chance for downtime and vacations. This means we’ve not been quite as active with our staff tasks, but as promised we’ll be using October to begin our server migration.

- And on the topic of server migration, we’ve begun! Sort of. We placed our server order with Ionos on the 6th of October, though there’s been issues with having my paypal/bank as fallback payment methods and sadly Ionos support are yet to respond after several days. Hopefully we can get a resolution this week, and spend the remainder of the month completing our migration. Keep an eye on #announcements for any significant updates we have to share before then.
