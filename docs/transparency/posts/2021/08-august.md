**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:** 

-	We spent much of the month focusing our attention on the #staff-transparency channel. The engagement with and response to the channel was far greater than we anticipated, and we’d once again like to thank everyone that contributed to these discussions. You can find the export of our channel [here](https://discord.com/channels/146701388234227712/597097924991647774/872130631025426483).

-	We’re looking into upgrading our server host in the next couple months. We’ve spent a lot of time looking at possible server hosts, and since our announcement spent some more time investigating how viable buying a server outright would be. Sadly that avenue has still proved to not be financially sensible, and so we’re now focusing our attention on assessing whether Ionos can be viable long term, or whether we can use a proxy to offset any EU connection issues. Watch this space for more information.

-	We’ve updated our bots to use the new slash commands. Many of the commands you know and love now use Discord’s new interactive UI, with helpful prompts for the optional fields.

-	We’ve given the gamenight server installer some huge feature upgrades. You can now install Vanilla servers, as well as a Paper server with UhcCore preinstalled! We’ve also got support for installing different versions - we now support version 1.2.5+ for Vanilla, and 1.8.8+ for Paper! These were the two most requested features for Gamenight, and can hopefully provide far more versatility for community events. Type `/gamenight` to get started.
