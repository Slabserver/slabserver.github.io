Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the past month:

- We introduced a new Staff Member, Chester, to provide an alternative means of contacting us for those that feel less comfortable messaging one of us directly. Chester has had a lot of modmail messages since joining the team, keep them coming!

- We wrote a collection of [documentation](./../../../documentation/) to increase our transparency around infrastructure, plugins, and staff processes.

- We launched our new TerraFirmaCraft server, once more unto the breach of modded server headaches.

- We added a ['Picture of the Month'](https://discord.com/channels/146701388234227712/813525859696377896/837840821217787935) functionality to Modbot, after it was raised in [#suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/146701388234227712/549320896590905344/814204632300781598)

- We made a couple of improvements to our dear Survival server:
    - Fixed a bug where [player respawn points would get ignored on relog](https://github.com/DaMarine/Slabserver-Bugs/issues/36).
    - Re-added the much loved feature from Season 2 where the song ‘Alpha' would playing on Etho's head after 20 seconds.

- We said goodbye to Frogperson, who decided to retire from the staff team.
    - We've deferred a number of our kanban tasks that were associated with Frog, though may revisit these again in the future.

- We 'fridgified' the Resource World, after the community sacrificed any good naming convention in the name of... kitchen appliances.

- We begun early discussions and preparations for our 1.17 update this summer - stay tuned for more information once Mojang announce an official date.
