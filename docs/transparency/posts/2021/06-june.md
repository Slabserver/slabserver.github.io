### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 9th of June 2021⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We completed work on a new feature for Sethwing that will [let you create Gamenight servers!](https://i.imgur.com/OXRJrC5.png) This feature isn't live quite yet, but in the next week or two, you'll be able to type `!gamenight` in #gamenight or to Sethwing, and in 30 seconds have a brand new server instance to configure for events. 
  - These servers will last for 72 hours, and you'll be able to download backups of these Gamenight servers, to restore to a new server several weeks later if you so wish. Look out for a message in #gamenight for when this feature goes live!

- We're working on additional anti-raid measures for the Discord, in response to the recent account spam we encountered:
    - Some bolstering to our `!lockdown` command - along with some code changes, we'll now start testing this command on a regular cadence in our test server as well as the live Discord server, where you all silently cheer with us if it works or laugh alongside us if it doesn't! Win-win!
    - Some bot changes that should hopefully detect, and respond to, any surge or raid of members. While we won't explain this in detail, we're hopeful that it should prevent us being raided in the same or similar fashion again.

- We've continued some of our discussions around upgrading to 1.17, particularly around the Resource World. We hope to use the 1.18 datapack in a new Resource World cycle once we reset, to lessen the impact of Caves and Cliffs Part 2 being delayed, and provide a more enjoyable Slabserver 1.17 gameplay experience. Once we're more sure of when Slabserver will update, and whether it syncs up with the typical RW schedule, we'll have more to share on this.

- We've given the Spawn Design server a similar treatment to the Snapshot server, so that it will be able to easily update to any new Minecraft snapshot or pre-release, as soon as it's released.
