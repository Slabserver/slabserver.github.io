### Donation Breakdown
**Breakdown Between 5th Of September - 5th Of October:**

N.B. As of October 2025, our dedicated server host Hetzner have changed our invoice billing date from the 4th to the 25th of each month. This change was [formally announced in August 2025](https://docs.hetzner.com/general/others/invoice-date-change-starting-august-2025/), though only took effect for us in our invoice for this month.

As the Transparency Reports have typically run from the 5th -> 5th of each month _(due to Hezner previously billing on the 4th, and Patreon paying on ~5th)_, there was therefore no server cost within that timeframe this month.

The Transparency Report timeframes will be updated in January 2026.

Costs/Donations |      $
---|---
Monthly Paypal Donations¹| $3.53
Monthly Patreon Donations¹| $94.89
Total Donations (Month)| $98.42
Existing Rollover Donations| $776.91

### State of the Slab
State of the Slab resumes in [January 2026](../2026/01-january.md), following an extended hiatus throughout 2025.

We thank you all for your continued donations, support, and patience throughout this time. Despite the lack of Transparency Reports throughout the year, the funding that Slabserver has received from you all was truly incredible to see, and is a testament to how self-sustaining this community has become over the past decade. On behalf of the entire staff team, thank you.

November 2025's Transparency Report effectively gets billed for almost two months instead.

The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots. You can find more detail on this [in our documentation](../../../documentation/minecraft/server-architecture.md).</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>

<sup>⁴ There will be occasions that certain items on the board are redacted, should they still be in [draft](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#creating-draft-issues), or contain sensitive tasks or information.</sup>
