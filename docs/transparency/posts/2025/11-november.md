### State of the Slab
State of the Slab resumes in [Janauary 2026](../2026/01-january.md), following an extended hiatus throughout 2025.

We thank you all for your continued donations, support, and patience throughout this time. Despite the lack of Transparency Reports throughout the year, the funding that Slabserver has recieved from you all was truly incredible to see, and is a testament to how self-sustaining this community has become over the past decade. On behalf of the entire staff team, thank you.

<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots. You can find more detail on this [in our documentation](../../../documentation/minecraft/server-architecture.md).</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>

<sup>⁴ There will be occasions that certain items on the board are redacted, should they still be in [draft](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#creating-draft-issues), or contain sensitive tasks or information.</sup>
