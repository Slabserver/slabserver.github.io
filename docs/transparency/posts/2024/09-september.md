<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots. You can find more detail on this [in our butts](../../../butts/minecraft/server-architecture.md).</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>

<sup>⁴ There will be occasions that certain items on the board are redacted, should they still be in [draft](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#creating-draft-issues), or contain sensitive tasks or information.</sup>

<sup>⁵ The [Priority](../../../assets/images/kanban/Priority.png) and [Size](../../../assets/images/kanban/Size.png) labels for our State of the Slab Board are a rough estimate of the amount of work involved, and quite honestly are just assigned based on vibes.</sup>
