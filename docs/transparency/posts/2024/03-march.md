### State of the Slab

**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 12th March 2024⁴:**

![State of the Slab March 2024](./../../../assets/images/kanban/2024/March.png "State of the Slab March 2024")


**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We've moved [slabserver.org/shopping-district](https://slabserver.org/shopping-district) over to our Slabserver Documentation pages, hot on the heels of the [lag](https://slabserver.org/lag) change last month.

- We've updated the `x.slabserver.org` links to redirect to their `slabserver.org/x` equivalent instead, which can be updated instantly and should have _really_ been the way we did things from the start. This marks a step towards deprecating the old `x.slabserver.org` links, though we'll give plenty of time and warning before that happens. **Note that all servers will continue using the `x.slabserver.org` format.**

- We cleaned up and archived a number of unused Pterodactyl backups to free up storage - we cannot wait to free up all the space being consumed by Season 3!

- We implemented a fix to get around the Bungeecord [issue](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/issues/3509) that was causing players to get kicked when running medium-large scale operations with Axiom. Shoutout to the Axiom dev Moulberry, who was kind enough to provide us a workaround.

- We've begun the Season 4 seed search, a very exciting occasion that was marred by [marbywarby](https://i.imgur.com/P3C4iOH.png) and his insanity at identifying what various islands looked like. Don't ask, can't explain.

- We released the Great Slabserver Poll results, and continued to discuss more of the qualitative answers in our staff meetings. As a change to the 2023 Poll results review, we're aiming to make more frequent, incremental changes over the course of this year, than one "big bang" suite of changes. Watch this space!

- We are deprecating the cryptocurrency donation links, effective immediately. They were initially added due to community request, and then promptly never used again.

- We were coerced into photoshopping a bunch of [cat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147057212458532865/1217213272462196736/twistcat.png?ex=66033532&is=65f0c032&hm=b6b757e47ac224901060310e1e85fcb926fe6ee18da9a55c07f2477f8cc155c4&)[s](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147057212458532865/1209273198919688304/tomcat.png?ex=660201ed&is=65ef8ced&hm=948b2648f1409e49e1ec7f13ea4b036ce315d62a45d0735cc9eb9a3f8c24aaa3&) in voice for some community members, which considerably slowed down progress on many of our ongoing staff tasks. The next time you ask yourself _"why didn't staff get x, y, and z done sooner?"_, this is why. Blame your peers.
