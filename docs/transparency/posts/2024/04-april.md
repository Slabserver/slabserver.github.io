### State of the Slab

**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 15th April 2024⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We made a huge April Fools server prank for the server, playing off of the 'End is Near' Season 3 reset propaganda
  - This was by far our hardest April Fools to achieve, though once again a huge shoutout to the Axiom mod, without which this wouldn't have been possible.
   - The world download for April Fools 2024 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bXsx2tKQfEAHd32dNs6ptXuo2OxyxG-4/view?usp=drive_link)!

- We've updated [slabserver.org](https://slabserver.org) to be far fancier now, and it no longer uses the reddit embed. Go check it out!
- We've enabled the Community feature within our Discord, which allows the "Browse Channels" feature to hide individual channels from the left sidebar.

- We fixed a bug on Slabserver where advancements would occasionally be announced twice in chat.

- We've created a forum channel for suggestions called #feedback, and archived the original #suggestions channel. This was largely in response to some of the feedback we received from the community about the structure and constructive nature of #suggestions, and we hope to see more feedback topics here in the coming months⁵.

- We've started moving our slabserver.org registrar from Google Domains to Cloudflare, because [Google can't keep a good thing alive](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

- We [updated our architecture page](../../../documentation/minecraft/server-architecture.md) to make it clearer that our whitelists and banlists apply to, and are shared, across all servers within both of our proxies.

- We made a bunch of Slabserver logos that show as embeds for our various GitHub Pages - here's an [example](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/351605320/51d618cf-5583-45da-8683-e5f2ef62f7bb)!
  - We've used a common template for these logos, so that the format can easily be extended in the future for various other projects and announcements - see the Season Four and Vault Hunter announcement logos as examples.
  - The template Blockbench files, along with some usage guidelines, are available over at the Slabserver Documentation "[Downloads](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Documentation/wiki/Downloads)" page.
