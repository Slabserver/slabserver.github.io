### State of the Slab

**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 5th February 2024⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We announced Season 4 of our Survival server, planned for June or July, shortly after the release of 1.21. We've compiled a [Season 4 FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Do3ta_D4G-rKP6s3jceqOenqZVEcmyd9xpE4DXfHm9I/edit?usp=sharing), with further plans and details to be announced in the coming months!

- We announced the conclusion of our discussion around client mod usage, including easy place, free cam, and inventory mods. More details on these decisions can be found in our [client mod document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_H7z2UmXTWPXnXtIlWvOyR0jSxevfWm_EuJdaDwGAE/edit?usp=sharing), and we've updated the Slabserver Documentation pages on [macros](https://slabserver.org/macros) and [client mod rules](https://slabserver.org/mods) as well.

- We fixed the [Ender Evolution](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Tweaks/wiki/Ender-Evolution) datapack and advancement not working in 1.20.2+.
- We fixed Disc 11 being inaudible while playing the last level of the Tunnel in 1.20.2+.

- We fixed Etho's Wrench and The Tunnel not working in 1.20.4.

- We fixed a bug with the application bot where Mojang seemed to deprecate an API endpoint without warning - see the Mojira bug report [here](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-6861).

- We personally paid for a server license of Axiom, and allowed its use on our Creative server. There are no plans to support this permanently, but we expect to renew this license until August 2024. See our announcement [for more information](https://discord.com/channels/146701388234227712/597097924991647774/1203323209416441937).
  - N.B. there is an unfortunate bug with Bungeecord where medium-large scale operations with Axiom can result in a kick. We are [investigating](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Bugs/issues/65), and the root of the problem appears to be [this](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/issues/3509) Bungeecord issue.

- We've moved [slabserver.org/lag](https://slabserver.org/lag) over to our Slabserver Documentation pages. In the process we've found at least one more link that needs moving - but not for this Transparency Report!
