### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 12th of January 2022⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We've updated our servers to 1.18! This update was largely smooth sailing for us, with the only challenge being Paper’s longer and fairly uncommunicative update process.

- We’ve implemented some more anti-raid features into Modbot to combat recent attempts to troll the Discord. This includes increased requirements to ping roles, and some other undisclosed measures to catch troll-like behaviour from new joiners.

- We’ve added the small improvement of letting you manually delete gamenight servers created by the Slabserver Server Server earlier than their standard 72h lifecycle.

- We’ve rolled out contextual join messages for the Discord, nearly a year later than intended! We have a few extra Etho inside jokes for usernames that end with er, ar, 3r, oo, and ou - have you seen any so far? Let us know if you have any suggestions for join messages, contextual or otherwise!
