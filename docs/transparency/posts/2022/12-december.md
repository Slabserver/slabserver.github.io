### State of the Slab

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout December:**

- We hosted a Slabserver Christmas Event! Thanks to everyone that turned up for this, it was a lot of fun and hopefully had a fun variety of events for everyone. The good news is there's a ton of ideas left over to host a similar event again over Summer!

- We had a pretty quiet month otherwise, as everyone wound down over Christmas and New Years <3
