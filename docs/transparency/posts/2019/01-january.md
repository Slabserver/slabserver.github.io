### Donation Breakdown
**Breakdown Between 19th Of December - 19th Of January:**

Costs/Donations |      $
---|---
Monthly Paypal Donations¹| $47.25
Monthly Patreon Donations¹| $53.53
Total Donations (Month)| $100.78
Existing Rollover Donations| $47.64
---|---
Server Cost² | $65.99
---|---
**Remaining Donation Funds³**  |  **$82.43**

A lot of our remaining donation funds were used last month due to running both Bisect and So You Start concurrently in case of emergencies, as well as the pretty costly set up fee. Moving forward we'll need a higher donation amount to keep consistently breaking even, but plan to set up more servers for the community and will be making it clear to people that's only possible long term with a little help from more people who aren't currently donating. If you are, and you've read this far in the post, thank you so much.
