### Donation Breakdown

**Remaining Donation Funds²**   |  **$47.64**

 A lot of our remaining donation funds have been used this month due to running both Bisect and So You Start concurrently in case of emergencies, as well as the pretty costly set up fee. Moving forward we'll need a higher donation amount to keep consistently breaking even, but plan to set up more servers for the community and will be making it clear to people that's only possible long term with a little help from more people who aren't currently donating. If you are, and you've read this far in the post, thank you so much.
