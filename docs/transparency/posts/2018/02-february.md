<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² Domain renewal occurs every February for us. We have now transferred this to Google Domains rather than handling it through our server provider.</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>
