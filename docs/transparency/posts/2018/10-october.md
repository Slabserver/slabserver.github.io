<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² We resolved the Paypal fee issue by just boycotting them. Frogperson is now being sent the VPS money via Circle.</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>
