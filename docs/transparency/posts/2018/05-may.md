<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² Paypal are now trying to charge a transaction fee of $2.56 to send this money to Frogperson. We don't understand why the dramatic change in fees, and are investigating further.</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>
