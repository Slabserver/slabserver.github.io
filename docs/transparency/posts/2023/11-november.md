**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We finished migrating all of the prior Transparency Reports to GitHub. Now that this move is complete and all reports converted to [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm), we'll begin looking at a better UI and URL for the various Slabserver wiki pages as per issue #192 on the kanban board.

- We continued - and have largely concluded - roundtable discussions to review our processes and philosophy for how we approach moderation, and now have a number of actionable items from these talks. As communicated in September's report, we expect to share more info on this soon.

- We've explored a number of ways to try and address the ongoing connection issues that players in the APAC region have experienced, and at this time the only solution would be finding an EU-based server. The most competitive server offering to ours is [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex101/configurator), though sadly, we have no way of trialing this without paying a ~€150 upfront cost to order the server, and the monthly fees are a notable step up from our current pricing.
  - At this time, the staff team cannot commit to covering the shortfall in funds indefinitely, particularly with no guarantee that this will address our issues. To consider such a server move, we'd need to see a sustained amount of donations that entirely cover this increase for at least 3-6 months. We remain open to exploring this possibility further in the future with a wider community push, or finding other servers and solutions to this.
