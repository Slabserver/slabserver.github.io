**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We released the results of The Great Slabserver Poll of 2023. You can find our announcement on the actions we’ve taken in response to feedback in [this main post](https://www.reddit.com/r/slabserver/comments/10sqluc/the_great_slabserver_poll_2023_results_and_actions/), as well as being summarized below.
    - You can find our poll data visualized [here](https://imgur.com/a/LUjEw3b).
    - We granted Locksmiths the ability to time-out members, as a more granular control method than initiating lockdowns. As always, abuse of this power will result in its removal.
    - We created a new #gaming channel, which is being trialled in the Community Games category.
    - We added @WatchParty and @Civilization roles for #gamenight, by popular request.
    - We created a wiki page with a list of allowed and disallowed mods for clarity and more centralised documentation [here](../../../documentation/minecraft/client-mods.md).
    - We discussed future use of Forum Channels in our Discord, and hope to trial them for the next `#modded-bulletin` channel.
    - We’ll be reviewing our rule regarding low effort/quality content for more consistent application. We’ve received conflicting feedback on this over the past few years, so we will be taking some time with this trying to define what low quality content is and examples of conditions in which such content may be removed.
    - For the first time since Season 3 began, we’ve recorded a small majority of members being in favour of a survival server reset. As indicated on the question, we have no plans to reset at this time, but we will continue to monitor community feedback on this issue.
    - We’re trialling some changes to #food and #pictures regarding the Picture of the Month feature to try to make the user experience more natural. We’ve changed the emote from the trophy to the yum emote in #food, and SethWing will automatically add the trophy emote to images in #pictures. SethWing will not count its own vote when tallying results for Picture of the Month.

- We've created a [downloads](../../../documentation/general/downloads.md) page with links to world downloads and resource packs we’ve released over the years. This is part of wider ongoing efforts to archive more of our communities media over the years, and will be updated in the future as more important downloads and torrents become available.

- We removed the Resource World message that warned players the Discord integration will not work while the main world is empty. This issue was fixed several months ago, but is being documented now!

- We hosted the Hermitfan UHC after many months of planning, to great success - not only did our organisation and infrastructure help the event run smoothly and with barely a hitch, our team won too! You can find Duo's wonderful video of the event [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EijaGbaHPiE), and after the overwhelmingly positive feedback about the event, we hope to host more cross-community events later this year.

- We've made changes to how these Transparency Reports are compiled - MC has very kindly offered to help me collate these as we go throughout the month, to try and make sure the reports are more punctual! Thank you, MC :)
