**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We've been internally reviewing our processes and philosophy for how we approach moderation. This is twofold - in response to problematic and polarising members that continually push boundaries without breaking rules, as well as responding to the lapse in continued dialogue with the staff team about these members.
  - **We hope to address this in a way that restores this dialogue, and provides the community with a clearer, more observable outcome for reporting moderation issues or members to us.** This has started with roundtable discussions with some trusted community members that we feel have had a good overview of the situation, and we hope we will have more to share on this soon.
