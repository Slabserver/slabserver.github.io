### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 5th August 2023⁴:**

![State of the Slab August 2023](./../../../assets/images/kanban/2023/August.png "State of the Slab August 2023")

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We updated our Survival and Creative servers to 1.20.1.

- We did some behind-the-scenes pruning of our storage, most notably of CoreProtect. For now, this only affects entity deaths more than 6 months old.

- We contacted an artist from /r/minecraft to inquire about commissioning slabserver artworks, and hope that in the future we'll have more to share from them!
