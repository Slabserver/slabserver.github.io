**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout January:**

- We released The Great Slabserver Poll of 2023, gathering demographics, suggestions, and feedback from the community. We got a whopping 216 responses this year, more than ever before, and are going to take the next couple of weeks to discuss and work through the results. Keep an eye on #suggestions in case we decide to bring any of it to the community, and also #announcements for the full results soon!

- We updated all of our servers to 1.19.3, after a hesitant rollout due to the number of backend changes Mojang have made with the experimental 1.20 changes included in this update.
    - For those who may still be wondering, we have no intentions of enabling the experimental features on our survival server. Both Paper and Mojang have made clear that there will be no official support or upgrade paths for worlds that enable these features.
