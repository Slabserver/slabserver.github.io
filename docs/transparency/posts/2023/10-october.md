### State of the Slab
**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 15th October 2023⁴:**

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We have continued to migrate the Transparency Reports across to GitHub, reformatting each one to better suit [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) in the process, which has been one of the most mind-numbing and monotonous tasks I have ever had to do in this community. On the bright side, we now have a pretty sidebar. Yay.

- We have been asked a number of times recently whether we can provide any information on how long Season 3 is guaranteed to continue for. This has largely been driven by people being hesitant to commit to projects without having some assurances it won’t be wiped during progress in the next few months. **While atypical of us to comment on, we feel it is reasonable to confirm that there could not be a reset before April 2024.**
    - This is **NOT** any indicator of a reset following that date, and instead a simple statement of logistics. We expect to survey the community again in January 2024 as part of the yearly [Great Slabserver Poll](https://discord.com/channels/146701388234227712/146702455487463424/1060241299824975963), which gives us a useful reference point to the reset sentiment in previous years. Even if 100% of the community asked for a reset then, the technical and logistical arrangements for a new season can easily take 3 months, which is why we are comfortable making this guarantee.
      - We will provide any further extensions to this guarantee in the new year, as a result of feedback in The Great Slabserver Poll. [Terms and conditions apply](https://gist.github.com/DaMarine/bf9c06511257d3cb82d286dbba6fe90e).
