### State of the Slab

State of the Slab resumed in [July 2023](07-july.md), due to our discussions surrounding the move of Transparency Reports away from [/r/slabserver](https://www.reddit.com/r/slabserver).

As Reddit continued to show flagrant disregard for its community, most recently with their treatment of third party app devs and users, it served as a reminder that the days of /r/slabserver were sadly served, and that these reports should be consolidated.

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>
