### State of the Slab

**Current staff tasks being tracked as of 1st February 2026⁴⁵:**

![State of the Slab February 2026](./../../../assets/images/kanban/2026/February.png "State of the Slab February 2026")

**Here's a recap of the staff team actions throughout the last month:**

- We've added three new Community Moderators, to help with day-to-day duties of running Slabserver and bring a diverse set of skillsets and perspectives to the team! They've done a great job of getting involved already and we can't wait to see how the team continues to change and evolve thanks to having them onboard.
  - This has been a great opportunity to review our internal documentation and knowledge of what it takes to onboard new members, and has led to some useful process and tooling improvements for us!
- We launched a Hytale server! We worked pretty hard to have this available at launch for people, and after various authentication and performance issues at launch it's been pretty stable overall. We'll keep running this into the medium-long term if there's sustained interest in the game as it continues to receive updates.
- We made a number of changes and improvements to one of our Resource World plugins:
  - Boat types other than Oak can finally transfer again (excluding Chest Boats, due to an ongoing duplication bug we are trying to prevent)
  - Endermites can finally transfer, after having been missed from the transfer list since the Resource World was created(!)
  - Future mob additions/changes in the game shouldn't require additional changes on our end (unless we need to block them from being transferred)
- We fixed a long-standing bug where emojis with underscores would not display correctly in our `#⁠ingamechat` Discord channel.
- We've been doing some prep work ahead of releasing the Great Slabserver Poll results, including some greatly improved data and results visualisations thanks to the help of our Technical Assistants. Watch this space!

<sup>¹ Donation amount listed is after transaction fees have taken place.</sup>

<sup>² The dedicated server hosts all of our game servers, databases, as well as our various Discord bots. You can find more detail on this [in our documentation](../../../documentation/minecraft/server-architecture.md).</sup>

<sup>³ Unless disclosed otherwise, this will always be put forward towards next months server costs, and will be displayed in ‘rollover donations’ within the transparency report.</sup>

<sup>⁴ There will be occasions that certain items on the board are redacted, should they still be in [draft](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#creating-draft-issues), or contain sensitive tasks or information.</sup>

<sup>⁵ The [Priority](../../../assets/images/kanban/Priority.png) and [Size](../../../assets/images/kanban/Size.png) labels for our State of the Slab Board are a rough estimate of the amount of work involved, and quite honestly are just assigned based on vibes.</sup>
