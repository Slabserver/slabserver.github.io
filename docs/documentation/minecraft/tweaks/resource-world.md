# Resource World

The Resource World is an extension of Slabserver - a separate world that synchronises with the Main World, which has no worldborder but periodically resets with a new Overworld, Nether, and End. 

The purpose of the Resource World is to alleviate the increasing item scarcity that occurs on Survival Multiplayer servers, with a gameplay solution that stays as thematically close to 'vanilla' as we can.

## Using the Resource World

To enter the Resource World, throw an Ender Pearl through the worldborder in the Overworld.

To exit the Resource World, travel to the `0,0` coordinates, find Etho's [clay patch](https://youtu.be/O7ZOjkPfDig?t=49), and break a block of the clay.

When travelling to and from the Resource World, your inventory, Ender Chest, Advancements, Statistics, [and more](https://william278.net/docs/husksync/sync-features) will synchronise between the worlds. You can also transfer almost any mob or vehicle entity, if they are in close proximity to the player when they enter/exit the Resource World.

!!! warning
    Due to how [Map](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Map) items store their data, there is no simple way of synchronise or transfer unlocked maps across worlds. Only locked maps can be synchronised. See the [HuskSync butts](https://william278.net/docs/husksync/sync-features#map-syncing) for more information.

## Resets, Seeds, and Names

Resource World resets occur every two months, typically on the 1st of that respective month. The Resource World will go offline approximately 24 hours prior to this, to allow for pre-generation of the new seed.

Seeds are completely randomised for each reset. On rare occasions, staff may curate or reroll a seed if the previous seed had low amounts of important biomes.

Each reset of the Resource World is affectionately named, as a way of referring to and differentiating from previous iterations. Before each reset, names can be suggested and voted on in the `#resource-world-poll` channel on Discord.

Staff then review the results, potentially veto suggestions, and pick the top 5 names to advance to the second round of voting. The second round of voting happens in-game in a voting booth at Spawn, where each player may vote for only one name. 

Previous names and seeds for each Resource World can be found [below](#previous-seeds).

## Respawns and Deaths

You may set temporary respawn points in the Resource World, using a Bed or Respawn Anchor as normal. When you leave the Resource World, any temporary respawn point is removed.

Dying will respawn you at the temporary spawn point in the Resource World if you have one, or at your spawn point in the Main World otherwise. 

The End's exit portal in the Resource World will always respawn you at your spawn point in the Main World.


## Plugins, Tweaks and Gameplay

All of our gameplay [plugins](../server-plugins.md) and [tweaks](all.md) for Survival should work correctly in the Resource World. If you find an inconsistency between the Main World and Resource World, please contact a member of staff with more information.

In addition, the Dragon Egg cannot spawn in the Resource World after a [reset](#resets-seeds-and-names), in order to maintain its status as the rarest item in the game.
