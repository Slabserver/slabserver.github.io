# Wrench

The Wrench offers a convenient way to rotate blocks in Survival mode.

## Obtaining a Wrench

Drop the items on Soul Sand/Soil and then light the block to create Soul Fire.

- To obtain a basic "Rotate" wrench, drop a Carrot on a Stick into Soul Fire.
    - For the advanced wrenches:
        - Flip Wrench: Drop a Carrot on a Stick + Copper Ingot into Soul Fire.
        - Face Wrench: Drop a Carrot on a Stick + Gold Ingot into Soul Fire.

## Rotate Wrench
Cycles through different rotations, generally rotating clockwise.

## Flip Wrench
* Flips the block to the opposite rotation.

## Face Wrench
* Rotates the block to face the side of the block the player has aimed at, similar to how logs are placed.
  * e.g. if player clicks the top surface of a piston, the piston will face "up".
* The Wrench will also flip the block if it's already facing the side the player clicked, if possible.
