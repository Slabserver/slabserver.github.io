# Chunkloader Guidelines

To ensure server performance and a smooth experience for all players on Slabserver, chunkloaders must follow the guidelines below.


## Guidelines

- **You must request approval from the staff team before using any chunkloaders.**
- Chunkloader usage must be kept to a minimum, with no chunkloader arrays. Players are allowed a maximum of `(simdistance +1)/4` chunkloaders.
    - For example, if the simulation distance is 8, players may have up to two chunkloaders.
- Chunkloaders must be easily disabled, with clear instructions provided on how to disable them.
- Chunkloaders should automatically turn off when no longer needed.
    - For example, a public Iron or Shulker farm must disable both the farm and the chunkloader when storage is full.
- All loaded chunks must comply with existing server rules, such as our [Anti-Lag Guidelines](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Documentation/wiki/Anti%E2%80%90Lag-Guidelines).

!!! note
    Staff reserve the right to disable a chunkloader at any time if it affects server performance or TPS for other players.


## Requesting Permission
- To request approval for a chunkloader, please message **@Chester** with the following information:

- The **intended purpose** of the chunkloader.
- The **exact coordinates** where the chunkloader can be disabled, along with instructions on how to do so.
- Any **additional features**, such as an auto-shutdown after a set time (e.g., "turns off after 5 minutes").
- **Confirmation** that you have read and understood the guidelines above.
- (Optional) Any other relevant details, such as MSPT estimates.

If approved, the staff team will add the chunkloader to an internal spreadsheet, for our own documentation and reference.
