# Basing Guidelines

Building the right base can be one of the most rewarding experiences in Minecraft. To help ensure that everyone has the best experience possible, we ask all community members to follow these guidelines.

### Finding a place to build
* Use the Pl3xMap to find an area which is a reasonable distance from the next nearest base. Ideally you should keep your neighbouring bases just outside of the server render distance (150+ blocks away). [link to map]
* Consider how large you want your base to be by the end of the season. Your base will also need to be a reasonable distance from your neighbours’ bases when it is completed.
* If you have any doubts about whether your base will encroach on others’ or whether a piece of land is still in use, send a message to the other player(s) involved.
* If you are unsure who to contact, send a message to the staff team via Chester and they will let you know. 

### Claims
* Only claim the amount of land that you actually believe you are going to use. 
* If any other players’ bases are nearby then let them know where your base boundaries will be, so they can raise any concerns before you start building.
* Only claim land for building (including building farms) on, resources can be collected from the resource world.  
* Clearly mark your base boundaries so that other players can see how much of the map remains unclaimed.
* Place a sign at your base to indicate who the base belongs to, unless you have already marked it on the server’s map. 
* To identify your base on the map of the server, name a banner, then place that banner where you want the marker and right-click the banner with an in-game map in your hand; it'll then show a map marker at that spot.
* If you are building any large redstone contraptions then claim land that is further away from spawn, and others’ builds, to prevent causing lag for others.

### Building considerately
* If your base is near others’ then place enough lighting to avoid creating an unplanned mob farm that will invade their territory.
* If you do create a mob farm or breed a lot of animals then ensure they are contained within your base area.
* Do not place any resources (i.e. unaged copper) or storage containers on others’ property as part of your building process without their consent.

### Server lag prevention
* If you are building with redstone then place blocks (ideally composters) on top of uncovered hoppers, and include off-switches for your builds where possible. 
* Any villagers near to your base should be kept more than 9 chunks (144 blocks) away from your base itself and should be kept to the minimum necessary. 
* Sharing villager trading halls with others is encouraged. 
* Do not keep your villagers in a permanent state of fear. 
* Make sure your farm has overflow protection so that anything you cannot store is destroyed, as well as (where possible) disabling the farm itself when not in use. 
* If your farm does a lot of filtering items or mob spawning, try to ensure it is only loaded when you intend to use it.
* Entity collision, including mobs colliding with each other, is a big source of lag. Don’t keep mobs or minecarts bunched-up in small areas (including water streams) for a long period of time.
* For full lag prevention guidelines see the Lag Guidelines page on this website: https://slabserver.org/documentation/minecraft/lag/ 

### Disputes
* If you have any concerns about how someone else’s build or actions may be affecting your build, then approach them in a friendly manner and see if you can resolve it between you.
* If you are unable to reach the person or resolve the issue yourself then you can contact the staff team via Chester.
* Any attempts to resolve issues by making changes to another player’s base may be considered griefing and griefing is not permitted on this server. 

### Nether Tunnels
* There are four core nether tunnels on Slab: North (white), South (grey), West (orange), and East (green). 
* The tunnel to place your base in is determined by the co-ordinates of your base when you press F3. Spawn is at X: 0, Z: 0; look at the co-ordinates for your base and see whether the ‘X’ co-ordinate, or the ‘Z’ co-ordinate is closer to zero; the co-ordinate that is closer to zero is the one to use. 
* If the X co-ordinate is higher than zero, then you are in the East tunnel, if it is lower than zero, then you are in the West tunnel. If the Z co-ordinate is higher than 0 then use the South tunnel; while if it is lower than 0, use the North tunnel.
* The floor of your personal nether tunnel needs to be on the same Y level as the floor of the main nether tunnel at Y: 111.
* Your personal nether tunnel needs to be spawn-proofed, whether by using clear ice for the floor or by using buttons, pressure plates, carpets, etc.  

### Roads Project
* There is currently a server-wide project to connect all of the bases on the server via a single Overworld road network which you can safely ride a horse down. 
* This project is optional, but it will benefit all players who wish to explore the world on horse, on foot, or by elytra.
* Check with your neighbours before placing any paths near their bases. 
* If you are connecting a road that you have built to a road that others have built, make sure the two look like they are meant to be connected. If you are unsure how to do this then ask others, but do not change blocks that others have placed.
* If you would like to join this community project then see the discussion thread for Overworld Road Project: https://discordapp.com/channels/146701388234227712/1270827485864661062 .
