### Getting Started
You can find an unofficial, community-written guide for Windows [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i4LC5sPDEf1dvd6OIK5IL46T43k4v-eM/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=104497508606139676974&rtpof=true&sd=true), though learning how to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started) and its [built-in Git tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git) is **highly** encouraged for those that would like to learn more industry-standard software.

Anyone who is a member of #technology and/or is using Linux has no excuse to not be contributing to this repository.
